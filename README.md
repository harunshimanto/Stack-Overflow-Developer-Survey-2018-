# [Welcome StackOverflow World From Bangladesh 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/harunshimanto/welcome-stackoverflow-world-from-bangladesh-2018)
Hello everyone from Bangladesh!! I bet everyone must be. Apart from the competitions, there are certain datasets which I found very cool. Most of these are dirty datasets and I think, the more you engage yourself in such datasets, the better you become. After all, in the real world, no one is going to give you a cleaned dataset. Cleaning is an important process and apart from other pre-processing stuff, I think data cleaning eats 70% of the time. Playing with messy datasets can help you become better at this task.

StackOverflow survey 2018 is another such kind of dataset. Though I won't say that it's too messy but yeah it is enough to make you sweat to figure out important features for your ML model that you might want to put on some of the subsets of this survey. So, let's dive in!!

PS: This will be a long kernel and I will be updating it from time to time. So look out for new things whenever you visit this ![dataset ](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey/data)page. Also, don't forget to up vote if you like it.

# Introduction
## StackOverflow:

Each year, we at Stack Overflow ask the developer community about everything from their favorite technologies to their job preferences. This year marks the eighth year we’ve published our Annual Developer Survey results—with the largest number of respondents yet. Over 100,000 developers took the 30-minute survey in January 2018.

This year, we covered a few new topics ranging from artificial intelligence to ethics in coding. We also found that underrepresented groups in tech responded to our survey at even lower rates than we would expect from their participation in the workforce. Want to dive into the results yourself and see what you can learn about salaries or machine learning or diversity in tech? We look forward to seeing what you find!

# Content
This 2018 Developer Survey results are organized on Kaggle in two tables:

survey_results_public contains the main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per question

survey_results_schema contains each column name from the main results along with the question text corresponding to that column

There are 98,855 responses in this public data release. These responses are what we consider “qualified” for analytical purposes based on completion and time spent on the survey and included at least one non-PII question. Approximately 20,000 responses were started but not included here because respondents did not answer enough questions, or only answered questions with personally identifying information. Of the qualified responses, 67,441 completed the entire survey.

# Acknowledgements
Massive, heartfelt thanks to all Stack Overflow contributors and lurking developers of the world who took part in the survey this year. We value your generous participation more than you know.

# Inspiration
At Stack Overflow, we put developers first and want [all developers to feel welcome and included on their site](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/04/26/stack-overflow-isnt-very-welcoming-its-time-for-that-to-change/). Can we use their annual survey to understand what kinds of users are less likely to identify as part of our community, participate, or feel kinship with fellow developers? Check out [their blog post](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/05/30/public-data-release-of-stack-overflows-2018-developer-survey/) for more details.

# Do coding , love analysis and vizualization.
